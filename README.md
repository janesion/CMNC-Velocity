# CMNC-Velocity
1998-2018 Present-day crustal movement of the Chinese mainland
A total of more than 260 continuous stations and 2000 campaign stations from the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) project, covering the Chinese mainland and its surrounding areas during the period of 1998–2018, are processed using the Bernese Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) software via a state-of-the-art method. We obtain the coordinate time series of all the stations given in the reference frame ITRF2014, estimate the coseismic deformation, and remove outliers. Lastly, we present the latest, most complete, and most accurate contemporary horizontal velocity field with respect to the stable Eurasian plate, irrespective of the postseismic deformations.
